# Proton AGI Forex Trading Robot

This is the code for the Proton AGI Forex Trading Robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This robot is designed to execute trades in the forex market based on complex trading strategies. It utilizes the Neuro FX EA for advanced trading strategies.

## How It Works

The Proton AGI Forex Trading Robot is an Expert Advisor (EA) that automates the trading process. It uses the Trade and Expert libraries to execute trades and implement trading strategies.

### Input Parameters

The code includes the following input parameters:

- `MagicNumber`: A magic number used to identify trades.
- `LotSize`: The lot size for each trade.
- `StopLoss`: The stop loss level in pips.
- `TakeProfit`: The take profit level in pips.

### Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is the initialization function for the Expert Advisor. It enables automated trading and sets the expert magic number.

### Trading Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main trading function. It checks if the Neuro FX EA is purchased and implements complex trading strategies based on the result. If the Neuro FX EA is not purchased, it displays a message to purchase it.

### Neuro FX EA Purchase Check

The `IsNeuroFXPurchased()` function checks if the Neuro FX EA is purchased. This function needs to be modified to include the actual code for checking the purchase status. Currently, it always returns true.

### Trading Strategy Implementation

The `ImplementTradingStrategies()` function is called when the Neuro FX EA is purchased. This function should include the code to implement complex trading strategies using indicators and market analysis techniques. Currently, it places a buy trade based on the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

### Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is the deinitialization function for the Expert Advisor. It can be used to clean up resources if necessary.
